# Docker Workshop 2019-01-17

This workshop includes 4 tutorials (the tutorials were taken from [willitscale's tutorial](https://github.com/willitscale/learning-docker), I recommend them if you want to learn more in depth about docker) and the example used during the presentation, any questions you have feel free ask.

At the moment I am hosting using a public github repository since some attendees will be using [PWD (Play With Docker)](https://labs.play-with-docker.com/). I also suggest using it if the internet connection in Tagus isn't the best.

To start this tutorial just clone the repository (`git clone https://github.com/jm4c/docker_workshop_2019-01.git`).

After the presentation this repository will be moved to https://github.ibm.com/Joao-Machado/docker_workshop_2019-01.
